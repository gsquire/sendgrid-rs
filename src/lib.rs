//! Unofficial Rust library for the SendGrid API.
//!
//! This crate requires Rust 1.15 or higher as it uses a crate that has a custom derive
//! implementation.
//!
//! sendgrid-rs implements all of the functionality of other supported SendGrid client libraries.
//! To use sendgrid-rs you must first create a SendGrid account and generate an API key. To create
//! an API key for your SendGrid account, use the account management interface or see the
//! [SendGrid API Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/API_Keys/index.html).
//!
//! sendgrid-rs is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sendgrid) and can be included
//! in your Cargo.toml as follows:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! sendgrid = "X.X.X"
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//! The projects has the following feature flags:
//! * `rustls`: this feature flag switches the default SSL provider in the operating system (usually
//! OpenSSL) with RusTLS, which is a TLS implementation in Rust.
//! * `native-tls`: enabled by default, this feature flag enabled the default SSL provider in the
//! operating system (usually OpenSSL).
//! * `async`: this feature flag changes the `send` function on the `SGClient` into an asynchronous
//! version. Note that without this feature flag, constructing an `SGClient` inside an asynchronous
//! function is not possible.
//!
//! ## Build Dependencies
//! This library utilises [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest). Follow the instructions on
//! the [reqwest README](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest#requirements) in order to enable
//! sending HTTPS requests to the SendGrid API.
//!
//! ## Example
//! An example of using this library can be found in the examples directory. This example code
//! expects to find your SendGrid API key in the process environment. In shells such as Bash or ZSH
//! this can be set as follows:
//!
//! ```shell
//! export SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.my.api.key"
//! ```
